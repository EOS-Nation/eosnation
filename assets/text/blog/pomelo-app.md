### Built with EOS Love

<p class='m-p-m-t-b'>
	This community driven project would not be made possible without the hard working & dedicated groups working day & night to make this a reality. The primary design of this application focuses on Enhanced Security for identity, create a standard protocol SDK that other EOS wallets can build on top of, written in modular React Native code to be reused in different React based applications and to write one base source code which supports both iPhone & Android devices.
</p>

<h2 class='m-p-m-t-b text-align-left'>Motivation for Native Mobile App</h2>

### Google Chrome Store is Blocked

<p class='m-p-m-t-b'>
	Many of the popular CryptoCurrency wallets today use the Google Chrome Store to host their application for ease of download and easy connectivity with web based applications. Unfortunately for the Chinese community the Google Chrome Store is blocked which prevents the EOS Chinese community to download such wallets.
</p>

### Mobile vs. Browser

<p class='m-p-m-t-b'>
	Nowadays, more and more people are solely relying on their mobile phone for daily activities with cryptocurrencies compared to Desktop/Browser based applications.
</p>

### Community Contributions

<p class='m-p-m-t-b'>
	To make this a reality, we are asking you “the EOS community” to help out with a few of the following contributions:
</p>

<ul class='markdown-list'>
	<li>Code review/testing to make sure everything is top notch secure!</li>
	<li>Design Logos/App Icons</li>
	<li>Download the app (**not yet released) and share with friends and family</li>
</ul>
