**Heinz Martin Breuer - Regional Director**

Hi. I'm born 1979. After a short episode of being one of Germany's youngest politicians (founding the local green party for minors), i decided to follow my passion for creativity and became a painter and musician. During my art studies i frequently traveled China, to research on my master thesis about eastern art philosophy. In 2008 finishing my Master degree, i moved all my production to Chengdu, Sichuan ,China. Since then i run a screen printing workshop here and a co-working space which hosted one of the first crypto meet-ups in Chengdu. I've been invested in Bitcoin since 2013, but now i'm heavily interested in the next generation platform crypto currencies. Disclaimer: I'm not big on western social media for numerous reasons, anyhow i think i'm pretty well set on Wechat.
