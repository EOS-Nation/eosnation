**Bhanu Prakash Katukojwala - EOS NATION AMBASSADOR**

I was graduated in 2015 from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India. Started career as a CAD designer in an MNC. Being enthusiastic to do business, I came across crypto currencies in June 2017. Knowing the potential of digital currencies in coming years, I invested in some projects like Ripple and Ethereum which would change the banking system and signing of contracts digitally across the globe. After quitting my job in march 2018, I have been a full time crypto trader and investor in new blockchain start-ups(ICOs). Recently, I have been certified in blockchain for businesses (hyper ledger technologies) online course from Linux foundation. Even more enthusiastic to gain knowledge on upcoming blockchain projects.
