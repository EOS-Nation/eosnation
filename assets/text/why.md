### EOS Nation's mission is to add value to the EOS ecosystem by focusing our efforts on education through community engagement. EOS Nation has been one of the most active Block Producer candidates, establishing a strong presence online in the various public EOS chats (most notably, in the Governance and Infrastructure channels) as well as across many cities around the world.Here are some examples that demonstrate EOS Nationâ€™s capacity to generate value for the network, which translates into value for all EOS token holders across the world.

## EOS Nation Meetups

### In the last few weeks, EOS Nation has hosted more than twenty EOS Nation Meetups in various countries including Canada, China, Nigeria, Ukraine, Kosovo, Switzerland and the USA. Our meetups vary in style and size, but all of them allow us to spread some EOS knowledge and build new relationships, which leads to a healthy and growing EOS community.
