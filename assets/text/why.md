We have engaged in many respectful and interesting conversations that have explored various aspects of EOS governance. Our efforts were always focused on prioritizing the interests of the community to make sure each and every one of you are represented at the highest level of EOS governance.Listen to Yves La Rose giving us a quick governance update (filmed June 1st)</h3>

<h3 class='m-p-m-t-b'> EOS Nation has been a leader in EOS-BIOS launch stages. We’ve proven to have a secure and robust BP infrastructure, using a secure meshed network topology using multiple layers of security.We also created and maintained the Scholar Test Net with the goal of providing a secure network where aspiring Block Producers could practice and learn how to configure an EOS block producing node. Block Producer candidates from around the world joined our testnet, and our lead engineer, Denis Carriere, was always there to help them connect and produce blocks. Time and time again, Denis has proven that EOS Nation has the technical expertise required to reliably produce blocks for the network.Read more about our Scholar Test Net and check out our GitHub repo.</h3>
