Our mission is to bring together all members of the EOS community under one project, under one roof. We want to represent you in the best way possible. We seek to offer you a place in this movement and in all decisions that will be made. By being accessible to the community in multiple jurisdictions, we will strive to contribute as best as we can to share this common vision we have for our future.

Our goal is to promote this movement around the world. We want to disseminate the societal benefits achievable through EOS through ongoing education, the sharing of knowledge and resources, community engagement, and the creation of projects. We believe this to be the most judicious way to foster the growth of the EOS community and the adoption of this new technology.
