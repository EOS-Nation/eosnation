<h3 class='m-p-m-t-b'> <span class='markdown-bold'>Each major Canadian city will be expected to host an EOS full node which will be under the support of EOS Nation. Proper training of setting up & maintaining an EOS full node will be provided by EOS Nation. Once a city has proven they have the technical knowledge and bare metal hardware to provide support as a full node, their node will be added to the EOS Nation cluster BP and they will start to collect EOS Rewards.</span></h3>
