## EOS Nation - Block Producer

### **Official block producer** candidate nameEOS NationLocation of company headquartersCanadaExpected location of serversHybrid approach - Cloud (AWS) for main full node & backup/secondary full nodes located in different geographical regions using bare metal.

* #### For the cloud infrastructure we will be hosting our virtual instances with AWS Canada in the Canada (Central) region.
* #### Bare Metal: The first two cities chosen by EOS Nation will be involved in the initial EOS testnet, the following expansion cities will soon follow after the EOS launch date.
* #### Toronto, ON (testnet)
* #### Ottawa, ON (testnet)
* #### Montreal, QC (proposed)
* #### Calgary, AB (proposed)
* #### Vancouver, BC (proposed)

### **Technical Specifications Hardware Proposed technical specifications and total expenditure of resources for BP.Notes:**

* #### Due to AWS's geographical hardware limitations, 4TB RAM is currently not available in AWS's Canada (Central) region.
* #### EOS.io has not yet defined the EOS Storage contract, the BP storage requirements may be upgraded and are subject to change if deemed valuable to the community.

### **Common Hardware Specifications**

* #### Geographical Region Toronto, Canada
* #### Geopolitical Region: Canada
* #### Operating System Ubuntu Server 16.10

### **BP "appointed"If EOS Nation is "appointed" as Block Producer, only 1 Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance will be running the main BP for the duration of the first election**

* #### Nodes 1x EC2 (x1.32xlarge)
* #### vCPUs 128 Cores
* #### Memory 2TB RAM
* #### Storage (IPFS) 2 x 1920GB (SSD)
* #### Network 25 Gigabit

### **BP "elected"If EOS Nation is "elected" as Block Producer, two Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances will be running as full EOS nodes. In the event of a failure of the main BP node, the secondary BP node will act as a backup and will become the main node. Minimal downtime shall be the main priority in case of a full node failure.**

### **Scaling Plan**
### **Each major Canadian city will be expected to host an EOS full node which will be under the support of EOS Nation. Proper training of setting up & maintaining an EOS full node will be provided by EOS Nation. Once a city has proven they have the technical knowledge and bare metal hardware to provide support as a full node, their node will be added to the EOS Nation cluster BP and they will start to collect EOS Rewards.**
