Being a Block Producer is a role that we take to heart. Ensuring the benevolence and guardianship of the network would be a privilege for us, one that we would take with utmost integrity. As a community, you have the ability to entrust with this paramount responsibility. As Block Producer, we will apply the constitution within the governance of the EOS protocol. We will promote freedom of expression by letting community members decide what needs to be censored or not. We will ensure that the community is heard and well represented at the highest level of EOS and EOS Nation governance.
