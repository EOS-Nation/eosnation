**LENNY GOUDREAULT - PMO**

While working in project management in construction, I have completed my Masters degree in architecture and am now working as an Architect graduate in the largest architecture firm in Gatineau, Quebec. I am also the co-founder of Cryptek which is an organisation that aims to build content in french to educate the community about cryptoassets and blockchain technology. We also organize meetups to share our knowledge with the community and I am thrilled to continue these efforts with the EOS Nation. I plan to transition into working full time in the crypto space once as soon as I have completed my current architecture commitments. My main goal is to share with the community the vision of decentralization and how it will impact our world positively. I am happy to be working toward Dan Larimer's vision for a non-violent society that is self-governed and where everyone's life, liberty and property are properly secured.
